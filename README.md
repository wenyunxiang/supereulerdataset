# supereulerian graph dataset
 The adjacent matrix dataset of supereulerian graph

The input is the number of vertices in the graph and the number of adjacency matrices to generate, separated by a space character.

The output is a data.txt file, each sample is saved as: the first line is the number of vertices of the graph, the second line starts with the adjacency matrix of the graph, and each element of the matrix is separated by a space character.
